# Dwellir - RPC Infrastructure Q3 Moonbeam

**Abstract**  - Dwellir is a leading IaaS (infrastructure as a service) team providing RPC infrastructure to more than 25 projects in the Dotsama ecosystem. We are proposing to receive payment for a geographically distributed public Moonbeam RPC API Service.

This service is currently available via:

wss://Moonbeam-rpc.dwellir.com  
[https://moonbeam-rpc.dwellir.com/  2](https://moonbeam-rpc.dwellir.com/)

**Motivation**  - a statement on why the Moonbeam Community via the Treasury Council should support the MBTP.

**Project Overview and Team Experience**  -

## Team

The Dwellir crew has over a decade of experience in the crypto domain and aims to expedite the development of web 3.0. We are experienced computer scientists, entrepreneurs, and crypto enthusiasts that share the ideas and philosophies around a free and decentralized web.

Gustav Nipe - CEO

Entrepreneur and political activist. Worked several years for the Swedish Pirate Party on privacy issues. Previous CTO at ImpactVision Inc (Acquired by Apeel Science 2020) a startup spawned from the Google Singularity University.

Erik Lönroth - DevOps lead

Technology Lead for High Performance Computing at Scania, past CIO ImpactVision Inc. Board member of Open Source Sweden.

Joakim Nyman - Solutions Architect

DevOps engineer at Imint AB, past lead developer at ImpactVision Inc.

Christian Ander - Institutional Partnership

President and founder of Goobit Group, a publicly traded crypto exchange in Sweden, BTCX.

Ankan Anurag - Senior Engineer

Senior engineer at Dwellir, past senior engineer at P.F.C. and Klarna.

Ben Chatwin - Operations Has worked for several high-tech startups in drones, machine learning and more recently for deFi projects across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

Dwellir is an infrastructure provider for the decentralized web. We run RPC services for Kusama and Polkadot and more than 26 other projects. Currently, we are processing 60 million JSON RPC requests per day.

We also provide validator/collator services for the networks [Kusama], [Polkadot and KILT and participated in the Thousand Validator Programme for Polkadot & Kusama.

We own and operate our own bare metal which has two important effects. The first is that we directly contribute to the real decentralization of the network away from public cloud providers. The second is that we can deliver an often better functioning service at a fair price.

Lastly, we are builders. We are working on a suite of tools associated with our infrastructure that aim to give insights to the community. An example of this work is a report produced for Parity. See the attached document for a link to the project.

**Rationale**  -

## Milestone 1 - Providing RPC services for Moonbeam

Setting up blockchain infrastructure is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive:

-   It requires a level of DevOps skills that many do not have. A Moonbeam node, for example, requires knowledge of SSL certificate handling, WebSocket management, HTTPS management, firewall configuration, security measures, monitoring, reporting, upgrades etc.
-   It’s extremely costly to run a node. Since we own and operate our infrastructure our cost structures are fair and more sustainable than cloud providers where one can expect huge increases in price.
-   Running production-level infrastructure is not trivial. You need to autoscale quickly to handle sudden increases in traffic which is very common when new projects launch. Our infrastructure uses a smart cluster stack whereby sudden increases in traffic are expertly scaled up and down as needed without the need for intervention.
-   It requires time. Time is the most valuable resource for projects. Most projects simply do not have the time to spend on DevOps, especially in crunch moments.

**Key Terms  _(optional)_**  - definitions of any terms within the proposal that are unique to the MBTP.

**Overall Cost**  -

USD : $7,072.20  
GLMR : 14,557.84 @ token price ( $0.4858)

**Use of Treasury Funds**  -

## Scope

We are builders first and want to ensure that we provide infrastructure and additional services that meet the community’s needs for the next decade!

This grant will enable us to continue the service we currently provide which entails:

-   Hosting of the Moonbeam node(s)
-   24/7 Monitoring of core functions including scaling mechanism
-   Continuous security improvements
-   Continuous updates, upgrades, and optimisations
-   Communication with development teams (where necessary)
-   Currently we operate three clusters in Northern Europe.

## Outcomes

There are three main outcomes:

1.  Improve the decentralization of the polkadot ecosystem by providing our own bare-metal infrastructure
2.  Improve the user experience within the Moonbeam ecosystem by ensuring the reliable availability of the network.
3.  Strengthen the team’s ability to work on core business problems as a result of reducing the strain on DevOps. We believe it’s important that parachain teams innovate on their core technology rather than spend time and resources on DevOps where we are clearly positioned to take the load.

**Specifications**  -

We own and operate our own bare metal which has two important effects. The first is that we directly contribute to the real decentralization of the network away from public cloud providers.

This is a combination of world-class hardware, open-source scalable software for managing complex infrastructure and our own custom monitoring stack.

**Steps to Implement**  -

We have already implemented this technology and have been running the chain successfully for more than 6 months. In the last 30 days, we processed more than 300 million requests for the users of Moonbeam and we’re looking forward to processing another 10 billion!
