Proposal: ZK Hackathon - Bounty for ZK Hackers on Moonbeam

Proponent: 0x39C78316C6Bc601cf45f5Ef20296f80e9b0A7039

Date: 03-16-2023

Requested GLMR: 5,000 USD, to be converted to GLMR using the EMA-30 GLMR price from  [Subscan  1](https://moonbeam.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price)  on the day of the submission

Short description: This proposal is to fund a bounty for builders who deploy tools or apps on Moonbeam during the ZK Hack Lisbon. The ZK Hack Lisbon is an event where hackers from the ZK space will be spending a full weekend experimenting with zero knowledge (ZK) technology and building ZK applications. Moonbeam presence on this event will serve as a closure to our Privacy on Moonbeam series and will be the perfect place to showcase how builders can leverage Moonbeam cross-chain hub to build privacy-focused apps taking as inspiration the previous use-cases we have explored in the  [series  1](https://youtu.be/ubGok0nbEPg)  where we showcased privatization of assets on Manta Network from Moonbeam using XCM.

On June 17th, 2022, we received 45K GLMR (~€19,350 at today’s prices) from the  [Moonbeam Treasury after submitting a Treasury Proposal  5](https://moonbeam.polkassembly.network/treasury/0)  for an educational event series named “Privacy on Moonbeam” set to run over the period from Q2 2022 to Q1 2023. Our goal was to promote the development of privacy tech within the Moonbeam ecosystem. We planned to host a Twitter Spaces, an online workshop and an IRL Hackshop (a smaller version of a hackathon focused on a handful of hackers). As of today, we have hosted Twitter spaces ([Nov 30th 2022](https://twitter.com/ZKValidator/status/1600052935550967808)) and  [the online event (Dec 14th)  1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubGok0nbEPg). Overall, we have spent ~€17K including the ops, tools and promotions for the online version of the series.

Current market conditions have reduced the value of our grant considerably, making it harder for us to organise a standalone IRL Hackshop. Therefore, we applied for and were awarded a Polkadot Event Child Bounty to sponsor the event, to be held at ZK Hack Lisbon, in which Moonbeam will have a core presence alongside Manta and another parachain. In this workshop, we will be showcasing the use of XCM to build private, interoperable apps.

The bounty we’re asking for in this proposal is for covering prizes for participants that build with Moonbeam tools. These prizes are crucial to attract interest from hackers looking to build on Moonbeam during the event.

Moonbeam will gain exposure to 150 ZK Hackers and will be one of the hosts of the 1h onsite workshop, which will be then uploaded to the ZK Podcast Youtube channel for broader distribution.

ZKValidator will return upon 5 days after the event, any funds leftover (in case not all bounties are distributed)

# [](https://forum.moonbeam.foundation/t/proposal-11-moonbeam-bounty-for-zk-hack-lisbon/617#payment-details-5)Payment Details

We are requesting 5,000 USD to be paid upfront, as this proposal consists of a single milestone.

This will be converted to a quantity of GLMR using the EMA-30 GLRM price from  [Subscan  1](https://moonbeam.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price)  on the date of submission.

The EMA-30 price is 0.40 USD on March 21st, 2023. Therefore 5,000USD /0.40 = 12500 GLMR.
