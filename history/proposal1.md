### Service Details

Since February 2021 we've provided a scalable free public API service so that everyone can access public pools of managed Moonbeam, Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha nodes. This provides the following three outcomes:

-   Grow the ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry to access a high performance nodes
-   Help scale existing projects in the ecosystem by providing infrastructure services that can be depended on
-   Assist with the testing of all networks by providing valuable data back to the community on how archive nodes are running and scaling as the network traffic increases

The time period from February 2021 to July 2022 was of huge growth for Moonbeam and OnFinality, this proposal only covers the period from the 1st February to 31st July. Over this period we served a total of 39,466,226,247.00 (39 billion) responses through our API service and almost 75 TB of data egress.

Weâ€™ve made significant enhancements to our service to better support Moonbeam including splitting and prioritising ethereum traffic to dedicated archive nodes. This has increased our node pool size but allows us to make significant optimisations in the effort to reduce latency and drive uptime. As a result, we have multiple clusters running in data centres around the world servicing tens of thousands of unique IP addresses.

We continued to execute on our efforts to provide unprecedented service stability and reliability to this ecosystem. All supported networks exceeded our 99.9% target, including 100% uptime for Moonbeam and 99.98% for Moonbase Alpha over the last 90 days to 12th August. At this stage, OnFinality is operationally striving for a minimum of 99.99% availability, which means less than an hour of downtime each year.
